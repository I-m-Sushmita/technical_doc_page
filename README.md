## Syntax
This section provides an example of the basic syntax in C, including a simple "Hello World!" program.
## Output (Print Text)
This section explains how to print text and output values using the `printf()` function in C.
## Variables
This section introduces variables in C, explaining different types of variables and their usage.
## Declaring Variables
This section details the syntax for declaring variables and provides examples of how to create and assign values to variables.
## Data Types
This section covers the various data types available in C, including basic, derived, enumeration, and void data types.
## Constants
This section explains how to define constants in C using the `const` keyword and the importance of read-only variables.
## Operators
This section describes the different operators available in C, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
## If else Statement
